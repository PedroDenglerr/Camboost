                            <h2>UNDERSTANDING CAMBRIDGE ENGLISH EXAMINATIONS</h2>
                            <p>Cambridge English Examinations are prestigious and internationally recognized tests administered by the University of Cambridge. They are designed to assess the English language proficiency of non-native English speakers and are used for educational, immigration, and occupational purposes. <strong>Below are detailed explanations of the five levels of Cambridge English Exams:</strong></p>
                            
                            <h3>Key English Test (KET - Elementary Level A2)</h3>
                            <p>This is the most basic level of Cambridge exams, demonstrating that the learner can communicate in English in simple situations. The main focus of the KET is to ascertain whether a student can understand and use everyday expressions, introduce themselves, ask and answer basic questions about personal details, and interact in a basic way when the other person talks slowly and clearly.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Preliminary English Test (PET - Intermediate level B1)</h3>
                            <p>At this level, learners should be able to read simple textbooks or articles, write simple personal letters, and understand arguments and opinions presented in spoken English. In other words, students should be able to cope with everyday situations like traveling, meeting new people, and writing reports or emails.</p>
                            
                            <h3>First Certificate in English (FCE - Upper Intermediate level B2)</h3>
                            <p>The FCE test indicates that the learner can use English effectively and can produce written work that requires a broad understanding of English grammar and vocabulary. It also demonstrates that the learner can understand the main ideas of complex English text.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Certificate in Advanced English (CAE - Advanced level C1)</h3>
                            <p>At the advanced level, students are capable of participating in discussions, expressing ideas clearly, and understanding complex texts intended for native speakers. It showcases a high level of competence in the English language, ideal for academic or professional purposes.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Certificate of Proficiency in English (CPE - Proficient level C2)</h3>
                            <p>This is the highest level of Cambridge exams, indicating that a learner has mastered English to a near-native level. A CPE recipient can understand a wide range of demanding texts and also express themselves fluently and spontaneously.</p>
